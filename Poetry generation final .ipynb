I can\\'t do it on my own\\n If this ain\\'t love, then what is?\\n I\\'m willing to take the risk I let it fall, my heart,\\n And as it fell you rose to claim it\\n It was dark and I was over\\n Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they\\'re strong\\n But my knees were far too weak\\n To stand in your arms\\n Without falling to your feet But there\\'s a side to you\\n That I never knew, never knew\\n All the things you\\'d say\\n They were never true, never true\\n And the games you play\\n You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain\\n Watched it pour as I touched your face\\n Well, it burned while I cried\\n \\'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,\\n Your name When I lay with you\\n I could stay there\\n Close my eyes\\n Feel you here forever\\n You and me together nothing gets better \\'Cause there\\'s a side to you\\n That I never knew, never knew\\n All the things you\\'d say\\n They were never true, never true\\n And the games you play\\n You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain\\n Watched it pour as I touched your face\\n Well, it burned while I cried\\n \\'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,\\n Your name I set fire to the rain\\n And I threw us into the flames\\n Well, it felt something died\\n \\'Cause I knew that that was\\n The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,\\n That heart you caught must be waiting for you\\n Even now when we\\'re already over\\n I can\\'t help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain\\n Watched it pour as I touched your face\\n Well, it burned while I cried\\n \\'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,\\n Your name I set fire to the rain,\\n And I threw us into the flames\\n Well, it felt something died\\n \\'Cause I knew that, that was the last time\\n The last time Let it burn\\n Let it burn\\n Let it burn Daydreamer\\n Sitting on the sea\\n Soaking up the sun\\n He is a real lover\\n And making up the past\\n Feeling up his girl\\n Like he\\'s never felt a figure before A jaw dropper\\n Looks good when he walks\\n Is the subject of their talk\\n He would be hard to chase\\n But good to catch\\n And he could change the world\\n With his hands behind his back, oh You can find him sittin\\' on your doorstep\\n Waiting for a surprise\\n And he will feel like he\\'s been there for hours\\n And you can tell that he\\'ll be there for life Daydreamer\\n With eyes that make you melt\\n He lends his coat for shelter\\n Plus he\\'s there for you\\n When he shouldn\\'t be\\n But he stays all the same\\n Waits for you\\n Then sees you through There\\'s no way I\\n Could describe him\\n What I\\'ll say is\\n Just what I\\'m hoping for But I will find him sittin\\' on my doorstep\\n Waiting for a surprise\\n And he will feel like he\\'s been there for hours\\n And I can tell that he\\'ll be there for life\\n And I can tell that he\\'ll be there for life With your loving, there ain\\'t nothing\\n That I can\\'t adore\\n The way I\\'m running, with you, honey\\n Is we can break every low\\n I find it funny that you\\'re the only\\n One I never looked for\\n There is something in your loving\\n That tears down my walls I wasn\\'t ready then, I\\'m ready now\\n I\\'m heading straight for you\\n You will only be eternally\\n The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion\\n Hitting me like an explosion\\n All of my life, I\\'ve been frozen\\n The sweetest devotion I\\'ve known I\\'ll forever be whatever you want me to be\\n I\\'ll go under and all over for your clarity\\n When you wonder if I\\'m gonna lose my way home\\n Just remember, that come whatever, I\\'ll be yours all alone I wasn\\'t ready then, I\\'m ready now\\n I\\'m heading straight for you\\n You will only be eternally\\n The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion\\n Hitting me like an explosion\\n All of my life, I\\'ve been frozen\\n The sweetest devotion I\\'ve known I\\'ve been looking for you, baby\\n In every face that I\\'ve ever known\\n And there is something \\'bout the way you love me\\n That finally feels like home\\n All my life, you\\'re my darkness\\n You\\'re the right kind of madness\\n And you\\'re my hope, you\\'re my despair\\n You\\'re my scope, everything, everywhere The sweetest devotion\\n Hitting me like an explosion\\n All of my life, I\\'ve been frozen\\n The sweetest devotion I\\'ve known Sweetest\\n It\\'s the sweetest\\n Sweetest\\n It\\'s the sweetest\\n Sweetest\\n It\\'s the sweetest\\n Sweetest\\n It\\'s the sweetest\\n Devotion [Verse 1]\\n When did it go wrong, I will never know\\n I have loved you all my life\\n How did it slow down, I go round and round\\n Thinking about it all the time [Pre-Chorus]\\n I gave you heaven on a platter baby\\n I gave you everything you never gave me\\n I never lied and I never faked it\\n Only wanted for you to save me\\n This love, it ain\\'t over yet\\n There\\'s too much that I haven\\'t said [Chorus]\\n Did you find the note that I wrote?\\n I hid it in the seam of your coat\\n It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat\\n Do you even know that I can\\'t let go [Verse 2]\\n Why were you so cold, let the truth be told\\n Tell me was it all for the thrill?\\n What was I thinking, I gave you everything\\n But you still went for the kill [Pre-Chorus]\\n I gave you heaven on a platter baby\\n I gave you everything you never gave me\\n I never lied and I never faked it\\n Only wanted for you to save me [Chorus]\\n Did you find the note that I wrote?\\n I hid it in the seam of your coat\\n It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat\\n Do you even know that I can\\'t let go [Bridge]\\n Oooh sometimes I feel like I\\'m in the dark\\n Oooh I thought I\\'d die in your arms [Chorus]\\n Did you find the note that I wrote?\\n I hid it in the seam of your coat\\n It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat\\n Do you even know that I can\\'t let go [Outro]\\n Hope you know, I won\\'t let go I thought I told you, he\\'d be home soon\\n Couldn\\'t help myself, you\\'re too good to be true.\\n I fall short each time,\\n Every time he ain\\'t here\\n You and your charm creep closer\\n Closer and near\\n Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all.\\n Like a bomb before explosion,\\n Ticking by your call,\\n You\\'re the wiser one, disguised from greed,\\n And I\\'m just a child who belongs on her knees. But I found a boy who I love more,\\n Than I ever did you before,\\n So stand beside the river I cried,\\n And lay yourself down.\\n Look how you want me now that I don\\'t need you. So, you thought that I\\'d crumble to my knees\\n At the first sight of you crawling back to me\\n To whisper \"will you leave your man? \"\\n Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.\\n I won\\'t stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more,\\n Than I ever did you before,\\n So stand beside the river I cried\\n And lay yourself down.\\n Look how you want me now that I don\\'t need you! I ain\\'t yours for no taking,\\n You must be mistaken\\n I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong\\n And ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more,\\n Than you ever did me before.\\n So stand beside the river you cried\\n And lay yourself down!\\n Look how you want me now that I don\\'t need you! Found myself today singing out your name,\\n You said I\\'m crazy,\\n If I am I\\'m crazy for you. Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here\\n Turns me crazy,\\n But it\\'s you who makes me lose my head. And every time I\\'m meant to be acting sensible\\n You drift into my head\\n And turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I\\'ll race,\\n If you want me to stop I\\'ll freeze,\\n And if you want me gone. I\\'ll leave, just hold me closer baby,\\n And make me crazy for you.\\n Crazy for you. Lately with this state I\\'m in I can\\'t help myself but spin.\\n I wish you\\'d come over,\\n Send me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it\\'s sweet taste for you,\\n Strips me down bare\\n And gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,\\n But the more I do,\\n The crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors,\\n Hoping you\\'ll walk through\\n And save me boy,\\n Because I\\'m too crazy for you.\\n Crazy for you Everybody tells me it\\'s \\'bout time that I moved on\\n And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young\\n But my heart is a valley, it\\'s so shallow and man made\\n I\\'m scared to death if I let you in that you\\'ll see I\\'m just a fake\\n Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch\\n But I know that\\'s just me, \\'cause nothing ever is enough\\n When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea\\n There was something in the water, now that something\\'s in me\\n Oh I can\\'t go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips\\n I can\\'t go back to the river But it\\'s in my roots, it\\'s in my veins\\n It\\'s in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But it\\'s in my roots, it\\'s in my veins\\n It\\'s in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain\\n So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea\\n Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it\\'s way too late\\n That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face\\n Consider this my apology, I know it\\'s years in advance\\n But I\\'d rather say it now in case I never get the chance\\n No, I can\\'t go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips\\n I can\\'t go back to the river But it\\'s in my roots, it\\'s in my veins\\n It\\'s in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain It\\'s in my roots, it\\'s in my veins\\n It\\'s in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea\\n Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea\\n Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham\\n If it hadn\\'t been for love\\n I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana\\n If it hadn\\'t been for love\\n I never woulda run through the blindin\\' rain\\n Without one dollar to my name\\n If it hadn\\'t been, if it hadn\\'t been for love I never woulda seen the trouble that I\\'m in\\n If it hadn\\'t been for love\\n Woulda been gone like a wayward wind\\n If it hadn\\'t been for love\\n Nobody knows it better than me\\n I wouldn\\'t be wishing I was free\\n If it hadn\\'t been, if it hadn\\'t been for love Four cold walls against my will\\n At least I know he\\'s lying still\\n Four cold walls without parole\\n Lord have mercy on my soul Four cold walls against my will\\n At least I know he\\'s lying still\\n Four cold walls without parole\\n Lord have mercy on my soul I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham\\n If it hadn\\'t been for love\\n I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana\\n If it hadn\\'t been for love\\n I never woulda loaded up a forty-four\\n Put myself behind a jailhouse door\\n If it hadn\\'t been, if it hadn\\'t been for love\\n If it hadn\\'t been, if it hadn\\'t been for love, yes\\n If it hadn\\'t been, if it hadn\\'t been for love, yes Hold my hand while you cut me down\\n It had only just begun but now it\\'s over now\\n And you\\'re in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold\\n I\\'m between the middle watching hastiness unfold\\n On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night\\n The night\\n When I fell off your mind I\\'m tired of trying\\n Your teasing ain\\'t enough\\n Fed up of biding your time\\n When I don\\'t get nothing back\\n And for what, and for what, and for what\\n When I don\\'t get nothing back\\n Oy, I\\'m tired Where\\'d you go when you stayed behind\\n I looked up and inside down and outside only to find\\n A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile\\n I get closer you obviously prefer her I\\'m tired of trying\\n Your teasing ain\\'t enough\\n Fed up of biding your time\\n When I don\\'t get nothing back\\n And for what, and for what, and for what\\n When I don\\'t get nothing back\\n Boy I\\'m tired of trying\\n Your teasing ain\\'t enough\\n Fed up of biding your time\\n When I don\\'t get nothing back\\n And for what, and for what, and for what\\n When I don\\'t get nothing back\\n Oy, I\\'m tired (I should have known) Never mind said your open arms\\n I couldn\\'t help believe they tricked me back into them, even though I\\'m tired of trying\\n Your teasing ain\\'t enough\\n Fed up of biding your time\\n When I don\\'t get nothing back\\n And for what, and for what, and for what\\n When I don\\'t get nothing back\\n Boy I\\'m tired of trying\\n Your teasing ain\\'t enough\\n Fed up of biding your time\\n When I don\\'t get nothing back\\n And for what, and for what, and for what\\n When I don\\'t get nothing back\\n Oy, I\\'m tired Who wants to be right as rain\\n It\\'s better when something is wrong\\n You get excitement in your bones\\n And everything you do\\'s a game\\n When night comes and you\\'re on your own\\n You can say I chose to be alone\\n Who wants to be right as rain\\n It\\'s harder when you\\'re on top \\'Cause when hard work don\\'t pay off\\n And I\\'m tired there ain\\'t no room in my bed\\n As far as I\\'m concerned\\n So wipe that dirty smile off\\n We won\\'t be making up\\n I\\'ve cried my heart out\\n And now I\\'ve had enough of love Who wants to be riding high\\n When you\\'ll just crumble back on down\\n You give up everything you are\\n And even then you don\\'t get far\\n They make believe that everything\\n Is exactly what it seems\\n But at least when you\\'re at your worst\\n You know how to feel things \\'Cause when hard work don\\'t pay off\\n And I\\'m tired there ain\\'t no room in my bed\\n As far as I\\'m concerned\\n So wipe that dirty smile off\\n We won\\'t be making up\\n I\\'ve cried my heart out\\n And now I\\'ve had enough of love Go ahead and still my heart\\n To make me cry again\\n \\'Cause it will never hurt\\n As much as it did then\\n We were both right\\n And no one had blame\\n But now I give up\\n On this endless game \\'Cause who wants to be right as rain\\n It\\'s better when something is wrong\\n I get excitement in my bones\\n Even though everything\\'s a strain\\n When night comes and I\\'m on my own\\n You should know I chose to be alone\\n Who wants to be right as rain\\n It\\'s harder when you\\'re on top \\'Cause when hard work don\\'t pay off\\n And I\\'m tired there ain\\'t no room in my bed\\n As far as I\\'m concerned\\n So wipe that dirty smile off\\n We won\\'t be making up\\n I\\'ve cried my heart out\\n And now I\\'ve had enough of love No room in my bed\\n As far as I\\'m concerned\\n So wipe that dirty smile off\\n We won\\'t be making up\\n I\\'ve cried my heart out\\n And now I\\'ve had enough of love So little to say but so much time\\n Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind\\n Please wear the face, the one where you smile\\n Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love, but I\\'m tired\\n I need to get away to feel again\\n Try to understand why, don\\'t get so close to change my mind\\n Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it\\'s bribing me to doubt myself\\n Simply, it\\'s tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind\\n And if I stay I\\'ll be alive\\n Then choke on words I\\'d always hide\\n Excuse me first love, but we\\'re through\\n I need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love, but I\\'m too tired\\n I\\'m bored to say the least and I, I lack desire\\n Forgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love\\n Forgive me first love forgive me, forgive me first love, forgive me first love This is the end\\n Hold your breath and count to ten\\n Feel the earth move and then\\n Hear my heart burst again For this is the end\\n I\\'ve drowned and dreamt this moment\\n So overdue I owe them\\n Swept away, I\\'m stolen Let the skyfall\\n When it crumbles\\n We will stand tall\\n Face it all together Let the skyfall\\n When it crumbles\\n We will stand tall\\n Face it all together\\n At skyfall\\n At skyfall Skyfall is where we start\\n A thousand miles and poles apart\\n Where worlds collide and days are dark\\n You may have my number, you can take my name\\n But you\\'ll never have my heart Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)\\n When it crumbles (when it crumbles)\\n We will stand tall (we will stand tall)\\n Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)\\n When it crumbles (when it crumbles)\\n We will

never be me\\n Without the security\\n Of your loving arms\\n Keeping me from harm\\n Put your hand in my hand\\n And we\\'ll stand Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)\\n When it crumbles (when it

Face it all together\\n At skyfall Let the sky fall\\n We will stand tall\\n At skyfall This is how the story went\\n I met someone by accident\\n It blew me away\\n Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days\\n When you took my sorrow and you took my pain\\n And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you\\n When the day is done\\n And wake up to your face against the morning sun\\n But like everything I\\'ve ever known\\n You disappear one day\\n So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station\\n Put a kiss on top of your head\\n Watch you wave\\n And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers\\n And neon lights and waiting papers\\n That I call home\\n I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you\\n When the day is done\\n And wake up to your face against the morning sun\\n But like everything I\\'ve ever known\\n You disappear one day\\n So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted\\n I\\'m going back to where I started\\n The morning rain, the morning rain\\n And though I wish that you were here\\n On that same old road that brought me here\\n It\\'s calling me home, It\\'s calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you\\n When the day is done\\n And wake up to your face against the morning sun\\n But like everything I\\'ve ever known\\n You disappear one day\\n So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away\\n I can\\'t spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet there\\'s air made of bricks\\n Pulls me down turns me weak for you\\n I find myself repeating like a broken tune\\n And I\\'m forever excusing your intentions\\n That I give in to my pretendings\\n Which forgive you each time\\n Without me knowing\\n They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up\\n You say my name like there could be an us\\n I best tidy up my head I\\'m the only one in love\\n I\\'m the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave\\n I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed\\n So desperately I try to link it with my head\\n But instead I fall back to my knees\\n As you tear your way right through me\\n I forgive you once again\\n Without me knowing\\n You\\'ve burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up\\n You say my name like there could be an us\\n I best tidy up my head I\\'m the only one in love\\n I\\'m the only one in love Why do you steal my hand\\n Whenever I\\'m standing my own ground\\n You build me up, then leave me dead I hear your words you made up\\n I say your name like there should be an us\\n I best tidy up my head I\\'m the only one, in love\\n I\\'m the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you\\n And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette\\n And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping you\\'d understand\\n And thinking you would listen to all of the things\\n The things I had planned But we couldn\\'t see eye to eye\\n So darling\\n Darling\\n Darling this is goodbye Oh\\n I still care\\n Fool that I am\\n Ooh\\n I still care\\n Fool that I am You say it\\'s all in my head\\n And the things I think just don\\'t make sense\\n So where you been then? Don\\'t go all coy\\n Don\\'t turn it round on me like it\\'s my fault\\n See I can see that look in your eyes\\n The one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder\\n Whenever you look at me I wish I was her\\n You shower me with words made of knives\\n Whenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you\\n You make it look like I\\'m see-through\\n Do tell me why you waste our time\\n When your heart ain\\'t in it, and you\\'re not satisfied\\n You know I know just how you feel\\n I\\'m starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder\\n Whenever you look at me I wish I was her\\n You shower me with words made of knives\\n Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again, I play the role of fool\\n (Just for you)\\n Even in the daylight when you think that\\n (I don\\'t see you)\\n Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find\\n Though I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder\\n Whenever you look at me I wish I was her\\n You shower me with words made of knives\\n Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder\\n Whenever you look at me I wish I was her\\n You shower me with words made of knives\\n Whenever you look at me I wish I was her [Adele]\\n Why do you love me\\n Do you love me...?\\n Why do you love me\\n Do you love me?\\n Why do you love me\\n Do you love me?

This is not rooted with you it don\\'t mean that much to me\\n Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free\\n How dare you think you\\'d get away with trying to play me Why is it every time I think I\\'ve tried my hardest\\n It turns out it ain\\'t enough\\n You\\'re still not mentioning love\\n What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?\\n I\\'m taking these chances and getting nowhere\\n And though I\\'m trying my hardest you go back to her\\n And I think that I know things may never change\\n I\\'m still hoping one day I might hear you say I make you feel the way you\\'ve never felt before\\n And I\\'m all you need and that you never want more\\n Then you\\'d say all of the right things without a clue\\n But you\\'d save the best for last\\n Like I\\'m the one for you You should know that you\\'re just a temporary fix\\n This is not rooted with you it don\\'t mean that much to me\\n Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free\\n How dare you think you\\'d get away with trying to play me But, despite the truth that I know\\n I find it hard to let go and give up on you\\n Seems I love the things you do\\n Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am\\n To persist with this heartbreak and running around\\n And I will do until I\\'m finding myself you And make you feel a way you\\'ve never felt before\\n And be all you need so that you never want more\\n And you\\'ll say all of the right things without a clue\\n And you\\'ll be the one for me and me the one for you I let it fall, my heart,\\n And as it fell you rose to claim it\\n It was dark and I was over\\n Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they\\'re strong\\n But my knees were far too weak\\n To stand in your arms\\n Without falling to your feet But there\\'s a side to you\\n That I never knew, never knew\\n All the things you\\'d say\\n They were never true, never true\\n And the games you play\\n You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain\\n Watched it pour as I touched your face\\n Well, it burned while I cried\\n \\'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,\\n Your name When I lay with you\\n I could stay there\\n Close my eyes\\n Feel you here forever\\n You and me together nothing gets better \\'Cause there\\'s a side to you\\n That I never knew, never knew\\n All the things you\\'d say\\n They were never true, never true\\n And the games you play\\n You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain\\n Watched it pour as I touched your face\\n Well, it burned while I cried\\n \\'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,\\n Your name I set fire to the rain\\n And I threw us into the flames\\n Well, it felt something died\\n \\'Cause I knew that that was\\n The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,\\n That heart you caught must be waiting for you\\n Even now when we\\'re already over\\n I can\\'t help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain\\n Watched it pour as I touched your face\\n Well, it burned while I cried\\n \\'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,\\n Your name I set fire to the rain,\\n And I threw us into the flames\\n Well, it felt something died\\n \\'Cause I knew that, that was the last time\\n The last time Let it burn\\n Let it burn\\n Let it burn [Adele]\\n I would never lie to you unless you tell me to...\\n Every part of

I can say that Ive tried\\n To tell you Im sorry\\n For breaking your heart\\n But it dont matter it clearly\\n Doesnt tear you apart anymore Hello how are you\\n Its so typical of me to talk about myself Im sorry\\n I hope that youre well\\n Did you ever make it out of that town\\n Where nothing ever happened Its no secret\\n That the both of us\\n Are running out of time So hello from the other side other side\\n I mustve called a thousand times thousand times\\n To tell you Im sorry\\n For everything that Ive done\\n But when I call you never\\n Seem to be home Hello from the outside outside\\n At least I can say that Ive tried Ive tried\\n To tell you Im sorry\\n For breaking your heart\\n But it dont matter it clearly\\n Doesnt tear you apart anymore Oh anymore\\n Oh anymore\\n Oh anymore\\n Anymore Hello from the other side other side\\n I mustve called a thousand times thousand times\\n To tell you Im sorry\\n For everything that Ive done\\n But when I call you never\\n Seem to be home Hello from the outside outside\\n At least I can say that Ive tried Ive tried\\n To tell you Im sorry\\n For breaking your heart\\n But it dont matter it clearly\\n Doesnt tear you apart anymore I will leave my heart at the door\\n I wont say a word\\n Theyve all been said before you know\\n So why dont we just play pretend\\n Like were not scared of whats coming next\\n Or scared of having nothing left Look dont get me wrong\\n I know there is no tomorrow\\n All I ask is If this is my last night with you\\n Hold me like Im more than just a friend\\n Give me a memory I can use\\n Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do\\n It matters how this ends\\n Cause what if I never love again I dont need your honesty\\n Its already in your eyes\\n And Im sure my eyes they speak for me\\n No one knows me like you do\\n And since youre the only one that matters\\n Tell me who do I run to Look dont get me wrong\\n I know there is no tomorrow\\n All I ask is If this is my last night with you\\n Hold me like Im more than just a friend\\n Give me a memory I can use\\n Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do\\n It matters how this ends\\n Cause what if I never love again Let this be our lesson in love\\n Let this be the way we remember us\\n I dont wanna be cruel or vicious\\n And I aint asking for forgiveness\\n All I ask is If this is my last night with you\\n Hold me like Im more than just a friend\\n Give me a memory I can use\\n Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do\\n It matters how this ends\\n Cause what if I never love again I let it fall my heart\\n And as it fell you rose to claim it\\n It was dark and I was over\\n Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands theyre strong\\n But my knees were far too weak\\n To stand in your arms\\n Without falling to your feet But theres a side to you that I never knew never knew\\n All the things youd say they were never true never true\\n And the games youd play you would always win always win But I set fire to the rain\\n Watched it pour as I touched your face\\n Let it burn while I cry\\n Cause I heard it screaming out your name your name When laying with you\\n I could stay there close my eyes\\n Feel you here forever\\n You and me together nothing gets better Cause theres a side to you that I never knew never knew\\n All the things youd say they were never true never true\\n And the games youd play you would always win always win But I set fire to the rain\\n Watched it pour as I touched your face\\n Let it burn while I cried\\n Cause I heard it screaming out your name your name I set fire to the rain\\n And I threw us into the flames\\n Where I felt something die cause I knew that\\n That was the last time the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door\\n As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you\\n Even now when its already over\\n I cant help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain\\n Watched it pour as I touched your face\\n Let it burn while I cried\\n Cause I heard it screaming out your name your name I set fire to the rain\\n And I threw us into the flames\\n Where I felt something die\\n Cause I knew that that was the last time the last time oh\\n Oh oh Let it burn oh\\n Let it burn\\n Let it burn Everybody loves the things you do\\n From the way you talk\\n To the way you move\\n Everybody here is watching you\\n Cause you feel like home\\n Youre like a dream come true\\n But if by chance youre here alone\\n Can I have a moment\\n Before I go\\n Cause Ive been by myself all night long\\n Hoping youre someone I used to know You look like a movie\\n You sound like a song\\n My God this reminds me\\n Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light\\n In case it is the last time\\n That we might be exactly like we were\\n Before we realized\\n We were sad of getting old\\n It made us restless\\n It was just like a movie\\n It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears\\n Nobody told me that youd be here\\n And I swore you moved overseas\\n Thats what you said when you left me You still look like a movie\\n You still sound like a song\\n My God this reminds me\\n Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light\\n In case it is the last time\\n That we might be exactly like we were\\n Before we realized\\n We were sad of getting old\\n It made us restless\\n It was just like a movie\\n It was just like a song When we were young\\n When we were young\\n When we were young\\n When we were young Its hard to win me back\\n Everything just takes me back\\n To when you were there\\n To when you were there\\n And a part of me keeps holding on\\n Just in case it hasnt gone\\n I guess I still care\\n Do you still care It was just like a movie\\n It was just like a song\\n My God this reminds me\\n Of when we were young When we were young\\n When we were young\\n When we were young\\n When we were young Let me photograph you in this light\\n In case it is the last time\\n That we might be exactly like we were\\n Before we realized\\n We were sad of getting old\\n It made us restless\\n Oh Im so mad Im getting old\\n It makes me reckless\\n It was just like a movie\\n It was just like a song\\n When we were young Whenever Im alone with you\\n You make me feel like I am home again\\n Whenever Im alone with you\\n You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever Im alone with you\\n You make me feel like I am young again\\n Whenever Im alone with you\\n You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you\\n However long I stay I will always love you\\n Whatever words I say I will always love you\\n I will always love you Whenever Im alone with you\\n You make me feel like I am free again\\n

you\\n I will always love you However far away I will always love you\\n However long I stay I will always love you\\n Whatever words I say I will always love you\\n I will always love you\\n I will always love you\\n Cause I love you When the rain is blowing in your face\\n And the whole world is on your case\\n I could offer you a warm embrace\\n To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear\\n And there is no one there to dry your tears\\n I could hold you for a million years\\n To make you feel my love I know you havent made your mind up yet\\n But I would never do you wrong\\n Ive known it from the moment that we met\\n no doubt in my mind were you belong Id go hungry Id go black and blue\\n Id go crawling down the avenue\\n No theres nothing that I wouldnt do\\n To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea\\n And on the highway of regret\\n The winds of change are blowing wild and free\\n You aint seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy make your dreams come true\\n Nothing that I wouldnt do\\n Go to the ends of the Earth for you\\n To make you feel my love To make you feel my love Ive made up my mind\\n Dont need to think it over\\n If Im wrong I am right\\n Dont need to look no further\\n This aint lust\\n I know this is love but If I tell the world\\n Ill never say enough\\n Cause it was not said to you\\n And thats exactly what I need to do\\n If Im in love with you Should I give up\\n Or should I just keep chasing pavements\\n Even if it leads nowhere\\n Or would it be a waste\\n Even If I knew my place should I leave it there\\n Should I give up\\n Or should I just keep chasing pavements\\n Even if it leads nowhere Id build myself up\\n And fly around in circles\\n Waiting as my heart drops\\n And my back begins to tingle\\n Finally could this be it or Should I give up\\n Or should I just keep chasing pavements\\n Even if it leads nowhere\\n Or would it be a waste\\n Even if I knew my place should I leave it there\\n Should I give up\\n Or should I just keep chasing pavements\\n Even if it leads nowhere yeah Should I give up\\n Or should I just keep chasing pavements\\n Even if

the sky not just the floor\\n I feel like my life is flashing by\\n And all I can do is watch and cry\\n I miss the air I miss my friends\\n I miss my mother I miss it when\\n Life was a party to be thrown\\n But that was a million years ago When I walk around all of the streets\\n Where I grew up and found my feet\\n They cant look me in the eye\\n Its like theyre scared of me\\n I try to think of things to say\\n Like a joke or a memory\\n But they dont recognize me now\\n In the light of day I know Im not the only one\\n Who regrets the things theyve done\\n Sometimes I just feel its only me\\n Who never became who they thought theyd be\\n I wish I could live a little more\\n Look up to the sky not just the floor\\n I feel like my life is flashing by\\n And all I can do is watch and cry\\n I miss the air I miss my friends\\n I miss my mother I miss it when\\n Life was a party to be thrown\\n But that was a million years ago\\n A million years ago Looking for some education\\n Made my way into the night\\n All that bullshit conversation\\n Baby cant you read the signs I wont bore you with the details baby\\n I dont even wanna waste your time\\n Lets just say that maybe\\n

dark\\n Finally I can see you crystal clear\\n Go head and sell me out and Ill lay your ship bare\\n See how Ill leave with every piece of you\\n Dont underestimate the things that I will do\\n Theres a fire starting in my heart\\n Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark Chorus 1\\n The scars of your love remind me of us\\n They keep me thinkin that we almost had it all\\n The scars of your love they leave me breathless\\n I cant help feeling we couldve had it all Youre gonna wish you never met me\\n Rolling in the deep Tears are gonna fall rollin in the deep\\n You had my heart inside of your hand Youre gonna wish you never met me\\n And you played it to the beat Tears are gonna fall rollin in the deep Verse 2\\n Baby I have no story to be told\\n But Ive heard one on you and Im gonna make your head burn\\n Think of me in the depths of your despair\\n Making a home down there as mine sure wont be shared Chorus 2\\n The scars of your love remind me of us\\n They keep me thinkin that we almost had it all\\n The scars of your love they leave me breathless\\n I cant help feeling we couldve had it all\\n Rolling in the deep you had my heart inside of your hand\\n And you played it to the beat\\n Couldve had it all Rollin in the deep\\n You had my heart inside of your hand\\n But you played it with a beating Verse 3\\n Throw your stone through every open door\\n Count your blessings to find what you look for\\n Turn my sorrow into treasured gold\\n You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow Chorus 3\\n We couldve had it all We couldve had it all\\n It all It all It all We couldve had it all\\n Rollin in the deep\\n You had my heart inside of your hand\\n And you played it to the beat\\n Couldve had it all\\n Rollin in the deep\\n You had my heart inside of your hand\\n But you played it you played it you played it you played it to the beat Some say Ill be better without you\\n They dont know you like I do\\n Or at least as far as I thought I knew\\n I cant bear this time\\n It drags as I lose my mind\\n Reminded by things I find\\n I know some clothes you left behind\\n Wake me up wake me up when all is done\\n I wont rise until this battles won\\n My dignity is become undone But I wont go\\n I cant do it on my own\\n If this aint love then what is\\n Im willing to take the risk\\n I wont go I cant do it on my own\\n If this is aint love then what is\\n Im willing to take the risk So petrified Im so scared to step into this right\\n What if I lose my heart and fail the \\n I wont forgive me if I gave up trying\\n I heard his voice today\\n I didnt know a single word he said\\n Now Im resemblance to the man I met\\n Just a vague and broken boy instead But I wont go I cant do it on my own\\n If this aint love then what is\\n Im willing to take the risk\\n I wont go I cant do it on my own\\n If this aint love then what is\\n Im willing to take the risk There will be times well try and give it up\\n Bursting at the seams no doubt\\n We almost fall apart and burn up easy\\n So watch them turn to dust\\n But nothing will never taint us I wont go I cant do it on my own\\n If this aint love then what is\\n Im willing to take the risk\\n I wont go I cant do it on my own\\n If this aint love then what is\\n Im willing to take the risk Will he will he still remember me\\n Will he still love me even when hes free\\n Or will he go back to the place where\\n He will choose the poison over me\\n When we spoke yesterday\\n He said to hold my breath to sit and wait\\n Ill be home soon I wont be late He wont go\\n He cant do it on his own\\n If this aint love then what is\\n Hes willing to take the risk\\n So I wont go I cant do it on his own\\n If this aint love then what is\\n Im willing to take the risk Cause he wont go\\n He cant do it on his own\\n If this aint love then what is\\n Were willing to take the risk\\n I wont go I cant do it on my own\\n If this aint love then what is\\n Im willing to take the risk I let it fall my heart\\n And as it fell you rose to claim it\\n It was dark and I was over\\n Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands theyre strong\\n But my knees were far too weak\\n To stand in your arms\\n Without falling to your feet But theres a side to you\\n That I never knew never knew\\n All the things youd say\\n They were never true never true\\n And the games you play\\n You would always win always win But I set fire to the rain\\n Watched it pour as I touched your face\\n Well it burned while I cried\\n Cause I heard it screaming Out your name\\n Your name When I lay with you\\n I could stay there\\n Close my eyes\\n Feel you here forever\\n You and me together nothing gets better Cause theres a side to you\\n That I never knew never knew\\n All the things youd say\\n They were never true never true\\n And the games you play\\n You would always win always win But I set fire to the rain\\n Watched it pour as I touched your face\\n Well it burned while I cried\\n Cause I heard it screaming out your name\\n Your name I set fire to the rain\\n And I threw us into the flames\\n Well it felt something died\\n Cause I knew that that was\\n The last time the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door\\n That heart you caught must be waiting for you\\n Even now when were already over\\n I cant help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain\\n Watched it pour as I touched your face\\n Well it burned while I cried\\n Cause I heard it screaming Out your name\\n Your name I set fire to the rain\\n And I threw us into the flames\\n Well it felt something died\\n Cause I knew that that was the last time\\n The last time Let it burn\\n Let it burn\\n Let it burn Daydreamer\\n Sitting on the sea\\n Soaking up the sun\\n He is a real lover\\n And making up the past\\n Feeling up his girl\\n Like hes never felt a figure before A jaw dropper\\n Looks good when he walks\\n Is the subject of their talk\\n He would be hard to chase\\n But good to catch\\n And he could change the world\\n With his hands behind his back oh You can find him sittin on your doorstep\\n Waiting for a surprise\\n And he will feel like hes been there for hours\\n And you can tell that hell be there for life Daydreamer\\n With eyes that make you melt\\n He lends his coat for shelter\\n Plus hes there for you\\n When he shouldnt be\\n But he stays all the same\\n Waits for you\\n Then sees you through Theres no way I\\n Could describe him\\n What Ill say is\\n Just what Im hoping for But I will find him sittin on my doorstep\\n Waiting for a surprise\\n And he will feel like hes been there for hours\\n And I can tell that hell be there for life\\n And I can tell that hell be there for life With your loving there aint nothing\\n That I cant adore\\n The way Im running with you honey\\n Is we can break every low\\n I find it funny that youre the only\\n One I never looked for\\n There is something in your loving\\n That tears down my walls I wasnt ready then Im ready now\\n Im heading straight for you\\n You will only be eternally\\n The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion\\n Hitting me like an explosion\\n All of my life Ive been frozen\\n The sweetest devotion Ive known Ill forever be whatever you want me to be\\n Ill go under and all over for your clarity\\n When you wonder if Im gonna lose my way home\\n Just

about it all the time PreChorus\\n I gave you heaven on a platter baby\\n I gave you everything you never gave me\\n I never lied and I never faked it\\n Only wanted for you to save me\\n This love it aint over yet\\n Theres too much that I havent said Chorus\\n Did you find the note that I wrote\\n I hid it in the seam of your coat\\n It was hard to write had a lump in my throat\\n Do you even know that I cant let go Verse 2\\n Why were you so cold let the truth be told\\n Tell me was it all for the thrill\\n What was I thinking I gave you everything\\n But you still went for the kill PreChorus\\n I gave you heaven on a platter baby\\n I gave you everything you never gave me\\n I never lied and I never faked it\\n Only wanted for you to save me Chorus\\n Did you find the note that I wrote\\n I hid it in the seam of your coat\\n It was hard to write had a lump in my throat\\n Do you even know that I cant let go Bridge\\n Oooh sometimes I feel like Im in the dark\\n Oooh I thought Id die in your arms Chorus\\n Did you find the note that I wrote\\n I hid it in the seam of your coat\\n It was hard to write I had a lump in my throat\\n Do you even know that I cant let go Outro\\n Hope you know I wont let go I thought I told you hed be home soon\\n Couldnt help myself youre too good to be true\\n I fall short each time\\n Every time he aint here\\n You and your charm creep closer\\n Closer and near\\n Like a fool for fire I fall with my pride and all\\n Like a bomb before explosion\\n Ticking by your call\\n Youre the wiser one disguised from greed\\n And Im just a child who belongs on her knees But I found a boy who I love more\\n Than I ever did you before\\n So stand beside the river I cried\\n And lay yourself down\\n Look how you want me now that I dont need you So you thought that Id crumble to my knees\\n At the first sight of you crawling back to me\\n To whisper will you leave your man \\n Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me\\n I wont stand by you Cause I found a boy who I love more\\n Than I ever did you before\\n So stand beside the river I cried\\n And lay yourself down\\n Look how you want me now that I dont need you I aint yours for no taking\\n You must be mistaken\\n I could never look into your eyes and settle for wrong\\n And ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more\\n Than you ever did me before\\n So stand beside the river you cried\\n And lay yourself down\\n Look how you want me now that I dont need you Found myself today singing out your name\\n You said Im crazy\\n If I am Im crazy for you Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here\\n Turns me crazy\\n But its you who makes me lose my head And every time Im meant to be acting sensible\\n You drift into my head\\n And turn me into a crumbling fool Tell me to run and Ill race\\n If you want me to stop Ill freeze\\n And if you want me gone Ill leave just hold me closer baby\\n And make me crazy for you\\n Crazy for you Lately with this state Im in I cant help myself but spin\\n I wish youd come over\\n Send me spinning closer to you My oh my how my blood boils its sweet taste for you\\n Strips me down bare\\n And gets me into my favorite mood I keep on trying fighting these feelings away\\n But the more I do\\n The crazier I turn into Pacing floors and opening doors\\n Hoping youll walk through\\n And save me boy\\n Because Im too crazy for you\\n Crazy for you Everybody tells me its bout time that I moved on\\n And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young\\n But my heart is a valley its so shallow and man made\\n Im scared to death if I let you in that youll see Im just a fake\\n Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch\\n But I know thats just me cause nothing ever is enough\\n When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea\\n There was something in the water now that somethings in me\\n Oh I cant go back but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips\\n I cant go back to the river But its in my roots its in my veins\\n Its in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But its in my roots its in my veins\\n Its in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain\\n So I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea\\n Yeah I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea I should probably tell you now before its way too late\\n That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face\\n Consider this my apology I know its years in advance\\n But Id rather say it now in case I never get the chance\\n No I cant go back but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips\\n I cant go back to the river But its in my roots its in my veins\\n Its in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain Its in my roots its in my veins\\n Its in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea\\n Yeah I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea\\n Yeah I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea I never woulda hitchhiked to Birmingham\\n If it hadnt been for love\\n I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana\\n If it hadnt been for love\\n I never woulda run through the blindin rain\\n Without one dollar to my name\\n

something is wrong\\n You get excitement in your bones\\n And everything you dos a game\\n When night comes and youre on your own\\n You can say I chose to be alone\\n Who wants to be right as rain\\n Its harder when youre on top Cause when hard work dont pay off\\n And Im tired there aint no room in my bed\\n As far as Im concerned\\n So wipe that dirty smile off\\n We wont be making up\\n Ive

to cry Forgive me first love but Im tired\\n I need to get away to feel again\\n Try to understand why dont get so close to change my mind\\n Please wipe that look out of your eyes its bribing me to doubt myself\\n Simply its tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind\\n And if I stay Ill be alive\\n Then choke on words Id always hide\\n Excuse me first love but were through\\n I need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love but Im too tired\\n Im bored to say the least and I I lack desire\\n Forgive me first love forgive me first love forgive me first love\\n Forgive me first love forgive me forgive me first love forgive me first love This is the end\\n Hold your breath and count to ten\\n Feel the earth move and then\\n Hear my heart burst again For this is the

someone by accident\\n It blew me away\\n Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days\\n When you took my sorrow and you took my pain\\n And buried them away you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you\\n When the day is done\\n And wake up to your face against the morning sun\\n But like everything Ive ever known\\n You disappear one day\\n So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station\\n Put a kiss on top of your head\\n Watch you wave\\n And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers\\n And neon lights and waiting papers\\n That I call home\\n I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you\\n When the day is done\\n And wake up to your face against the morning sun\\n But like everything Ive ever known\\n You disappear one day\\n So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away away Woke up feeling heavyhearted\\n Im going back to where I started\\n The morning rain the morning rain\\n And though I wish that you were here\\n On that same old road that brought me here\\n Its calling me home Its calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you\\n When the day is done\\n And wake up to your face against the morning sun\\n But like everything Ive ever known\\n You disappear one day\\n So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away\\n I cant spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet theres air made of bricks\\n Pulls me down turns me weak for you\\n I find myself repeating like a broken tune\\n And Im forever excusing your intentions\\n That I give in to my pretendings\\n Which forgive you each time\\n Without me knowing\\n They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up\\n You say my name like there could be an us\\n I best tidy up my head Im the only one in love\\n Im the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave\\n I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed\\n So desperately I try to link it with my head\\n But instead I fall back to my knees\\n As you tear your way right through me\\n I forgive you once again\\n Without me knowing\\n Youve burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up\\n You say my name like there could be an us\\n I best tidy up my head Im the only one in love\\n Im the only one in love Why do you steal my hand\\n Whenever Im standing my own ground\\n You build me up then leave me dead I hear your words you made up\\n I say your name like there should be an us\\n I best tidy up my head Im the only one in love\\n Im the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you\\n And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette\\n And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping youd understand\\n And thinking you would listen to all of the things\\n The things I had planned But we couldnt see eye to eye\\n So darling\\n Darling\\n Darling this is goodbye Oh\\n I still care\\n Fool that I am\\n Ooh\\n I still care\\n Fool that I am You say its all in my head\\n And the things I think just dont make sense\\n So where you been then Dont go all coy\\n Dont turn it round on me like its my fault\\n See I can see that look in your eyes\\n The one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder\\n Whenever you look at me I wish I was her\\n You shower me with words made of knives\\n Whenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you\\n You make it look like Im seethrough\\n Do tell me why you waste our time\\n When your heart aint in it and youre not satisfied\\n You know I know just how you feel\\n Im starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder\\n Whenever you look at me I wish I was her\\n You shower me with words made of knives\\n Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again I play the role of fool\\n Just for you\\n Even in the daylight when you think that\\n I dont see you\\n Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find\\n Though I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder\\n Whenever you look at me I wish I was her\\n You shower me with words made of knives\\n Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder\\n Whenever you look at me I wish I was her\\n You shower me with words made of knives\\n Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Adele\\n Why do you love me\\n Do you love me\\n Why do you love me\\n Do you love me\\n Why do you love me\\n Do you love me Why do you love me Why do you

said\\n At the dawning of the day\\n I cant wait to see the light\\n Make up memories in my head\\n They help to fill the emptiness youve left\\n I cant drown in your tears\\n I wont face your fears\\n I need to fight my own\\n Youll never see me again oh baby in time\\n Let the weight take me under\\n I know Ill survive\\n Youll never see me again At the dawning of the day\\n I cant bare to see the light\\n Make up memories in my head\\n They help to fill the emptiness youve left\\n I cant drown in your tears\\n I wont face your fears\\n I need to fight my own\\n Youll never see me again oh baby in time\\n Let the weight take me under\\n I know Ill survive Let the floor beneath of me fall\\n Let the sky come crashing down\\n Turn all my right to wrong\\n But after you that goes on\\n Youll never see me again\\n Ive been learning to live without you\\n Its taken all of my stake\\n But Im stronger now Youll never see me again oh baby in time\\n Let the weight take me under\\n I know Ill survive Let the floor beneath of me fall\\n Let the sky come crashing down\\n Turn all my right to wrong\\n But after you that goes on\\n Youll never see me again\\n Youll never see me again\\n Youll never see me again I want to see your face in every kind of light\\n In fields of dawn and forests of the night\\n And when you stand before the candles on a cake\\n Oh let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make What are you doing the rest of your life\\n North and South and East and West of your life\\n I have only one request of your life\\n That you spend it all with me All the seasons and the times of your days\\n All the nickels and the dimes of your days\\n Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days\\n All begin and end with me I want to see your face in every kind of light\\n In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night\\n And when you stand before the candles on a cake\\n Oh let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes\\n In the world of love that you keep in your eyes\\n Ill awaken whats asleep in your eyes\\n It may take a kiss or two Through all of my life\\n Summer Winter Spring and Fall of my life\\n All I ever will recall of my life\\n Is all of my life with you Wait do you see my heart on my sleeve\\n Its been there for days on end and\\n Its been waiting for you to open up\\n Yours too baby come on now\\n Im trying to tell you just how\\n Id like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally\\n Say that its always been me Thats made you feel the way youve never felt before\\n And Im all you need and that you never want more\\n Then youd say all of the right things without a clue\\n But youd save the best for last\\n Like Im the one for you You should know that youre just a temporary fix\\n This is not rooted with you it dont mean that much to me\\n Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free\\n How dare you think youd get away with trying to play me Why is it every time I think Ive tried my hardest\\n It turns out it aint enough\\n Youre still not mentioning love\\n What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly\\n Im taking these chances and getting nowhere\\n And though Im trying my hardest you go back to her\\n And I think that I know things may never change\\n Im still hoping one day I might hear you say I make you feel the way youve never felt before\\n And Im all you need and that you never want more\\n Then youd say all of the right things without a clue\\n But youd save the best for last\\n Like Im the one for you You should know that youre just a temporary fix\\n This is not rooted with you it dont mean that much to me\\n Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free\\n How dare you think youd get away with trying to play me But despite the truth that I know\\n I find it hard to let go and give up on you\\n Seems I love the things you do\\n Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am\\n To persist with this heartbreak and running around\\n And I will do until Im finding myself you And make you feel a way youve never felt before\\n And be all you need so that you never want more\\n And youll say all of the right things without a clue\\n And youll be the one for me and me the one for you I let it fall my heart\\n And as it fell you rose to claim it\\n It was dark and I was over\\n Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands theyre strong\\n But my knees were far too weak\\n To stand in your arms\\n Without falling to your feet But theres a side to you\\n That I never knew never knew\\n All the things youd say\\n They were never true never true\\n And the games you play\\n You would always win always win But I set fire to the rain\\n Watched it pour as I touched your face\\n Well it burned while I cried\\n Cause I heard it screaming Out your name\\n Your name When I lay with you\\n I could stay there\\n Close my eyes\\n Feel you here forever\\n You and me together nothing gets better Cause theres a side to you\\n That I never knew never knew\\n All the things youd say\\n They were never true never true\\n And the games you play\\n You would always win always win But I set fire to the rain\\n Watched it pour as I touched your face\\n Well it burned while I cried\\n Cause I heard it screaming out your name\\n Your name I set fire to the rain\\n And I threw us into the flames\\n Well it felt something died\\n Cause I knew that that was\\n The last time the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door\\n That heart you caught must be waiting for you\\n Even now when were already over\\n I cant help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain\\n Watched it pour as I touched your face\\n Well it burned while I cried\\n Cause I heard it screaming Out your name\\n Your name I set fire to the rain\\n And I threw us into the flames\\n Well it felt something died\\n Cause I knew that that was the last time\\n The last time Let it burn\\n Let it burn\\n Let it burn Adele\\n I would never lie to you unless you tell me to\\n Every part of me\\n All my words to hold\\n And hold against me\\n Why wont you let it be Dont you ever say my love opened up your heart\\n No Im not gonna do it standing up\\n The words dont come out right when youre right in front of me\\n Help me baby\\n Wont you turn off the lights Lay me down\\n til the morning\\n Lay me

Never been a girl who used to cry\\n Didnt show emotions dont know why\\n Didnt wanna feel the pain inside I guess But as the years keep going by\\n you came along and changed my mind\\n I should leave the past behind me\\n I should let you find me\\n supposed to stay beside me\\n You were supposed to guide me\\n through the ups and downs\\n you were always gonna be around until the end I still think we could\\n cause you and me were good\\n And Ill tell you why this hurts cause Im sober But I just wanna be drunk\\n so I can forget about you\\n and all the stupid things that love has put me through\\n Even when Ive had too much\\n I still feel your touch\\n Maybe this just means that Im not drunk enough So I pour myself another drink\\n whenever I start to think about you\\n cause I do but I really dont want to\\n but sometimes my dreams just come through And when I get there\\n to a place where I see you in a kitchen\\n I start wishing for that thing and I dont need you\\n I dont really wanna see you\\n and I dont want you to see me\\n you would think that I was crazy\\n you might think that I wanna be close to you\\n but Id rather wanna drink some Whisky\\n and maybe have a little sip o wine\\n cause right now its the only thing that makes me forget you were mine\\n but right now I am sober But I just wanna be drunk\\n so I can forget about you\\n and all the stupid things that love has put me through\\n Even when Ive had too much\\n I still feel your touch\\n Maybe this just means that Im not drunk enough I still think we could\\n Im not drunk enough\\n cause you and me were good\\n cause Im sober But I just wanna be drunk\\n so I can forget about you\\n and all the stupid things that love has put me through\\n Even when Ive had too much\\n I still feel your touch\\n Maybe this just means that Im not drunk enough I still think we could\\n But I just wanna be drunk\\n so I can forget about you\\n and all the stupid things that love has put me through\\n cause you and me were good\\n Even when Ive had too much\\n I still feel your touch\\n Maybe this just means that Im not drunk enough Think Ive had enough\\n I must my way\\n Ive fallen off the edge to find that Ive gone blind\\n Youre leading me astray\\n You haunt me like a ghost\\n And that scares me the most\\n There you are the devil on my shoulder\\n Smiling as the flames are growing colder\\n How can I believer what I have\\n For a little confidence Ill grab But when my hand goes out dont take it for Im trying to make it on my own\\n I fell it in my bones any minute now\\n This train of thought will leave the statio\\n My impatience will come out to play\\n Youve turned out to be the only face I see\\n Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone You spin a web in every room\\n You spin a web in every room\\n And try to break the backbone that Ive grown\\n Will I make my own path or wander where Im thrown\\n Will I make my own path or wander where Im thrown\\n Or wander where Im thrown When we used\\n To say goodnight\\n Id always kiss\\n And hold you tight\\n But lately\\n You dont seem\\n To care\\n You close the door\\n And leave me\\n Standing there\\n Oh honey\\n Thats not fair\\n Thats it\\n I quit\\n Im movin on The other night\\n We had a date\\n An you showed up\\n Two hours late\\n And though your hair\\n Was all in place\\n Somebody smeared\\n Their lipstick\\n On your face\\n Oh they smeared it\\n Every place\\n Ye thats it honey\\n I quit Im movin on Chorus\\n You made me want you\\n You made me leave you\\n You made me tumble\\n And fall\\n But if I\\n Cant have you the way\\n I want you\\n I dont want you at all Baby I can take a lot\\n Cause I love\\n Everything you got\\n Though your kisses\\n Fill me\\n So if you got\\n Someone else\\n I gotta go\\n Oh that you know\\n Ye thats it honey\\n I quit Im movin on Chorus Baby\\n I can take a lot\\n Cause I love\\n Everything you got\\n Though your kisses\\n Fill me\\n So if you got\\n Someone else\\n I gotta go\\n Oh that you know\\n So thats it baby\\n I quit Im movin on\\n Ye thats it baby\\n I quit now\\n Im movin on Dont ask me\\n What you know is true\\n Dont have to tell you\\n I love your precious heart I was standing\\n You were there\\n Two worlds collided\\n And they could never tear us apart We could live\\n For a thousand years\\n But if I hurt you\\n Id make wine from your tears I told you\\n That we could fly\\n Cause we all have wings\\n But some of us dont know why I\\n I was standing\\n You were there\\n Two worlds collided\\n And they could never ever tear us apart I know sometimes youre scared of the light\\n But how will you ever know if you never try\\n Theres something new inside my heart\\n And it

Take it as it comes\\n And be thankful when its done\\n Theres so many ways to act\\n And theres many shades of black\\n Theres so many shades of black Let it out let it all out\\n Say whats on your mind\\n You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind\\n Yeahsee if I care see if I stand firm or if I fall\\n Cause in the back of my mind and on the tip of my tongue\\n Is the answer to it all Chorus Yeah theres many shades of black Chorus Cause theres many shades of black\\n Theres so many shades of black\\n Yeah theres any shades of black\\n Theres so many shades of
